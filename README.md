# python-script-authentication
Python code that allows you to secure ur script

## How to use

use the code that is in this repository, but link ur own data (aka the hashes of ur keys in md5) where there are currently some example pastebins.
U will NEED to use something like nuitka (https://nuitka.net/) to compile ur code into an executable. to create a one-file executable, use the
command
"nuitka --onefile --standalone <PathToFile>" to create it. more info can be found in their docs. This script also adds support to use versions of files and 
  set versions in a pastebin that are currently valid. this can be used for multiple reasons(protection,safety,updates,...)
